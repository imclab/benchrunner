benchrunner is a standalone UI on top of benchmark.js.
It will run your benchmarks thru
[benchmark.js](https://github.com/bestiejs/benchmark.js)
and display the result in a webpage such as
[this one](http://jeromeetienne.github.com/benchrunner/).

The UI is widely inspired from
[mocha](visionmedia.github.com/mocha/)
by
[TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/visionmedia).



Here is a sample benchmark
[bench-example](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/benchrunner/blob/master/bench-example.js).

It is add ```#runall``` to the runner url. The benchmarks will start as soon
as the page is loaded.
